this is a try to setup some environment on my laptop using CHEF.

Mysteries to be solved:

* why and if chef-solo must be run by root?
TODO:

* do not hardcode user name, but have it fetched from systemn
* extract intellij cookbook to a separated cookbook to allow world to use it
* make intellij desktop shortcut work
